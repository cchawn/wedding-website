# Wedding Website Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building a fun and playful "coming soon" landing page for Christina & Peter's Fall 2026 wedding using Next.js with mouse-responsive confetti animations.

## Development Strategy
This plan breaks the implementation into 8 incremental steps, each building on the previous work. Each step is designed to be implementation-safe with no orphaned code, ensuring the project remains functional at every stage.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Foundation
**Goal**: Create a basic Next.js project with static export configuration

**Context**: Starting from scratch, we need a properly configured Next.js project that can be exported as a static site for easy hosting.

**Prompt**: 
```
Create a new Next.js project for a wedding website with the following requirements:
- Initialize Next.js with TypeScript support
- Configure next.config.js for static export (output: 'export')
- Set up a basic project structure with:
  - pages/index.tsx (main page)
  - styles/globals.css (global styles)
  - public/ directory for assets
- Create a simple "Hello World" page that displays "Christina & Peter - Coming Soon"
- Ensure the project builds successfully with `npm run build` and can be exported
- Add package.json scripts for development and static export
- Test that the exported site works locally

The page should be completely functional but minimal at this stage.
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- Next.js project initializes without errors
- Static export configuration works
- Basic page displays simple text
- Project builds and exports successfully

### Step 2: Typography and Font Integration
**Goal**: Integrate Google Fonts and establish typography hierarchy

**Context**: Building on the functional Next.js foundation, we now add the visual typography system with playful serif and script fonts from Google Fonts.

**Prompt**:
```
Enhance the existing Next.js wedding website with typography and Google Fonts integration:

Current state: Basic Next.js project with "Christina & Peter - Coming Soon" display

Add the following:
- Integrate Google Fonts API with these font families:
  - A playful serif font for main text (recommend: Crimson Text, Playfair Display, or Libre Baskerville)
  - A script font for decorative elements (recommend: Dancing Script, Great Vibes, or Pacifico)
- Update the main page to display:
  - "Christina & Peter" in the script font (larger, prominent)
  - "Fall 2026" in the serif font (medium size)
  - "Coming Soon" in the serif font (smaller, understated)
- Create proper typography hierarchy with appropriate font sizes and spacing
- Set up CSS custom properties (variables) for the font families
- Ensure fonts load efficiently with font-display: swap
- Add fallback fonts for each font family
- Test typography on different screen sizes

Maintain the same functional structure - only enhance the visual presentation.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Google Fonts load properly
- Typography hierarchy is clear and visually appealing
- Fonts have appropriate fallbacks
- Site remains functional with improved aesthetics

### Step 3: Color System and Gradient Backgrounds
**Goal**: Implement peach/pink gradient backgrounds and establish color system

**Context**: With typography in place, we add the vibrant gradient background system and color palette inspired by the reference designs.

**Prompt**:
```
Add a color system and gradient backgrounds to the wedding website:

Current state: Next.js project with Google Fonts and proper typography hierarchy displaying names, date, and "Coming Soon"

Implement the following:
- Create a CSS color system with custom properties for:
  - Primary peach/pink gradient colors
  - Secondary accent colors
  - Text colors with proper contrast ratios
- Design and implement a beautiful gradient background:
  - Use peach/pink tones as the primary palette
  - Create a vibrant, colorful gradient that covers the full viewport
  - Ensure the gradient complements the playful, fun aesthetic
- Update text colors to ensure excellent readability against the gradient
- Add proper contrast checking for accessibility
- Make the gradient responsive (works well on all screen sizes)
- Style the layout to center the content nicely over the gradient
- Add subtle spacing and positioning improvements

The content and structure should remain the same - focus on the visual color enhancement.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Beautiful gradient background implemented
- Excellent text contrast and readability
- Colors follow accessibility guidelines
- Responsive design maintained

  - Ensure proper touch targets for mobile
  - Optimize spacing for different viewports
- Add subtle visual enhancements:
  - Proper line height for readability
  - Appropriate margins and padding
  - Consider adding subtle shadows or visual depth
- Ensure the design works perfectly from 320px to 2560px widths
- Test layout with different content lengths (if names were longer)
- Add basic CSS transitions for smooth interactions

Keep the same content and color scheme - focus on layout, spacing, and responsiveness.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Content perfectly centered on all screen sizes
- Smooth responsive transitions
- Optimal spacing and typography scale
- Layout works across all device sizes

### Step 5: Basic Animation Foundation
**Goal**: Set up the animation system foundation and canvas preparation

**Context**: With the visual design complete, we prepare the technical foundation for the confetti animation system without implementing the full interaction yet.

**Prompt**:
```
Add the foundation for mouse-responsive confetti animations:

Current state: Responsive wedding website with proper typography, gradients, and layout

Add animation infrastructure:
- Set up an HTML5 canvas element for confetti animations:
  - Position canvas to cover the full viewport behind the content
  - Ensure proper z-index layering (content on top, canvas behind)
  - Make canvas responsive to window resizing
- Create basic confetti particle system structure:
  - Define a Confetti class/object for individual particles
  - Set up particle properties: position, velocity, color, size, rotation
  - Create colorful confetti particles (use vibrant colors that complement the design)
- Implement basic animation loop:
  - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth performance
  - Clear and redraw canvas on each frame
  - Add basic particle movement (falling effect for now)
- Add a few test confetti particles that fall from the top
- Ensure animations are performant and don't impact text readability
- Add proper cleanup for the animation loop

The mouse interactivity will be added in the next step - focus on getting the foundation solid.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Canvas properly positioned and responsive
