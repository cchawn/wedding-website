# Wedding Website Development Todo

## Project Status: Planning Complete ✅

**Current Phase**: Ready for Implementation  
**Next Step**: Begin Step 1 - Project Foundation  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-24

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] **Step 1: Project Foundation**
  - [ ] Initialize Next.js with TypeScript
  - [ ] Configure static export
  - [ ] Create basic project structure
  - [ ] Implement simple "Hello World" page
  - [ ] Test build and export functionality

### Phase 2: Visual Design
- [ ] **Step 2: Typography and Font Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate Google Fonts API
  - [ ] Set up playful serif font (main text)
  - [ ] Set up script font (decorative elements)
  - [ ] Create typography hierarchy
  - [ ] Add font fallbacks and optimization

- [ ] **Step 3: Color System and Gradient Backgrounds**
  - [ ] Create CSS color system/custom properties
  - [ ] Implement peach/pink gradient background
  - [ ] Ensure proper text contrast
  - [ ] Add accessibility compliance
  - [ ] Test responsive gradient behavior

- [ ] **Step 4: Layout and Responsive Design**
  - [ ] Create proper layout structure (Grid/Flexbox)
  - [ ] Implement mobile-first responsive design
  - [ ] Add responsive breakpoints
  - [ ] Optimize spacing and typography scale
  - [ ] Test across device sizes (320px-2560px)

### Phase 3: Animation System
- [ ] **Step 5: Basic Animation Foundation**
  - [ ] Set up HTML5 canvas element
  - [ ] Create confetti particle system structure
  - [ ] Implement basic animation loop
  - [ ] Add test confetti particles
  - [ ] Ensure performance and readability

- [ ] **Step 6: Mouse-Responsive Confetti System**
  - [ ] Implement mouse event listeners
  - [ ] Add mouse-responsive particle generation
  - [ ] Enhanced particle physics (gravity, rotation)
  - [ ] Add touch device support
  - [ ] Optimize performance and particle management

### Phase 4: Optimization & Production
- [ ] **Step 7: Performance and Accessibility Optimization**
  - [ ] Animation performance monitoring
  - [ ] Resource optimization
  - [ ] Accessibility improvements (reduced motion, semantic HTML)
  - [ ] Error handling and graceful degradation
  - [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

- [ ] **Step 8: Final Polish and Production Readiness**
  - [ ] Micro-interactions and final polish
  - [ ] Production readiness (favicon, meta tags, PWA setup)
  - [ ] Comprehensive testing (cross-browser, mobile, performance)
  - [ ] Documentation (README, deployment guide)
  - [ ] Future-proofing and maintainability

## Development Notes

### Current Priorities
1. Follow the step-by-step implementation plan in `plan.md`
2. Test thoroughly at each step before proceeding
3. Maintain functionality throughout the development process
4. Focus on performance and accessibility from the start

### Key Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Next.js with static export configuration
- [ ] Google Fonts integration (serif + script fonts)
- [ ] Peach/pink gradient backgrounds  
- [ ] Mouse-responsive confetti animations
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility compliance
- [ ] Fast loading performance
- [ ] Content: "Christina & Peter", "Fall 2026", "Coming Soon"

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance Score: 90+
- [ ] Lighthouse Accessibility Score: 100
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (tested on iOS/Android)
- [ ] Animation performance (60fps on modern devices)
- [ ] Static export builds successfully
- [ ] Hosting-ready deployment package

### Risk Management
- Animation performance monitoring at each step
- Fallback strategies for unsupported browsers
- Reduced motion alternatives for accessibility
- Error handling for canvas/animation failures

## Next Actions
1. Begin Step 1: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and static export
2. Verify basic functionality before proceeding to Step 2
3. Update this todo as each step is completed
4. Test thoroughly at each phase transition
